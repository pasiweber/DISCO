# DISCO: DISCO: Internal Evaluation of Density-Based Clustering with Noise Labels

This repository is the official implementation of DISCO: Internal Evaluation of Density-Based Clustering with Noise Labels, submitted to [IEEE ICDM 2025](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~icdm2025/index.html).

## DISCO - Score
[DISCO](src/Evaluation/disco.py) is designed on a pointwise level:
![Pointwise](./PointwiseExample.png)
The code used to generate these examples can be found [here](src/Experiments/JupyterNotebooks_SyntheticExperiments/Pointwise.ipynb).
## Results
Internal CVIs should reflect what external CVIs, like ARI, indicate when the ground truth is given. 
To assess this, we regard the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) between the CVI scores and the ARI values across various common clusterings. 
The shown PCC indicates the correlation between the CVIs given in the columns for the datasets given in the rows. 
As some edge cases, e.g., singleton clusters, are not defined for some CVIs, the PCC cannot always be computed (stated with --).

The scripts used to generate the results can be found [here](src/Experiments/scripts).

## Experimental Setup
We performed an ablation study to assess the sensitivity of DISCO regarding its only hyperparameter $\mu$:
![Ablation](./AblationMinPts.png)

The experiments for the ablation study can be found [here](src/Experiments/JupyterNotebooks_SyntheticExperiments/Ablation_Experiment.ipynb). We set our hyperparameter to $\mu$=5 across all experiments.
