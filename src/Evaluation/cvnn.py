    WE WANT THE ORIGINAL VERSION therefore we exclude the modifications (can be found in the comments)
    Function to calculate (a modified version of) CVNN

    Calculates CVNN
    (with some modifications, originally from Understanding and Enhancement of Internal Clustering Validation Measures, Liu et al.)
    Modifications:
    1. to calculate the overall Compactness, the mean is used instead of the sum of intra-cluster compactness-values
    2. Compactness is divided by the mean distance of points, so that CVNN can be compared between different data sets

    Args:
        dist (numpy.ndarray): a distance matrix
        labels (numpy.ndarray): a vector with labels
        k (int): number of nearest neighbors

    Returns:
        float: CVNN score
